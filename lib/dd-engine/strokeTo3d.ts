// WHAT CHANGED TO MAKE IT RUN HERE:

//  •  It imports only 'three', so it needed no adaptation at all. Every
//      constant, curve, guard, epsilon and comment is theirs.

// Everything below this header is Desk Doodles' code and Desk Doodles'
// comments. Those comments are the record of what was tried and why it

// sharp): run several passes, but PIN any vertex whose turn exceeds a corner
// threshold so a drawn SQUARE keeps its 90° corners while a circle's gentle
// staircase rounds into a true curve. Watertightness is preserved — smoothing
// only nudges existing boundary vertices toward their neighbours (the loop
